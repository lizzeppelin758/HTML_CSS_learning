1
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,541
"I'm warning you, I'm
going to get angry. Do you see?

2
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,119
"We are going to have fun
on this island, understand?

3
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,500
"We are going to have fun
on this island.

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,707
"'Come now, ' said the
Lord of the Flies.

5
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,885
"Get back to the others and
we'll forget the whole thing.

6
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,339
"This has gone quite far enough,
my poor, misguided child.

7
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,641
"Do you think you know
better than I do?"

8
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,969
Okay, so we have civilization
versus savagery,

9
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,397
and reason versus impulse.

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,225
So many exciting themes
in one little book, right?

11
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,107
Over the break, I want you to
read the next three chapters.

12
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,942
That's three chapters, and
I want you to write two pages...

13
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,697
on either one of our themes,
your choice.

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,454
Demerius.

15
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,497
Care to read us out to the bell?

16
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,081
No, no, no, not that one.
The one that you have on your lap there.

17
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,253
What is it?

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,340
Uh... Demon Sword Z.

19
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,629
Okay, let's hear it. Oh, come
on. Let's finish class strong.

20
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,888
"Now I have the power
of the five souls.

21
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,935
"Let us see what the
Gauntlet of Destiny...

22
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,017
"has to say about that,
demon lover.

23
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,771
"Then, the squid leg splits
Okami-san in half.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,106
"Blood sprays everywhere."

25
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,362
This is 26% stronger than
anything else on the market.

26
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,408
It lasts up to four hours.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,282
Not only are the lips fuller...

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,613
they're the most fantastic color.

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,453
Slight tingle at first,
but it's so worth it.

30
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,669
- Better than collagen.
- Where is this from?

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,214
The Orient... a lot of the
formulas are secret.

32
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,218
- I own the North American rights.
- Oh, that's lovely.

33
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,513
And this would be an exclusive
for Harold's.

34
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,136
That's really starting to work.

35
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,846
What kind of comic is this?

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,601
It's not a comic, it's manga.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,853
"Put your demon powers in me,
squid.

38
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,061
"I want to feel your might
deep within."

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,771
Damn, its tentacles are like
its dicks.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,107
- Zack, your right.
- "Hold back nothing, my pet.

41
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,535
- After I summon the demon, all you..."
- Mr. Moss. Hello.

42
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,037
We found some surprising
thematic similarities...

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,739
between Lord of the Flies...

44
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,544
Okay, all right.
You owe me two pages.

45
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,380
Have a really good break.

46
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,626
- Where is this from?
- Asia.

47
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,723
D-P-R-K... isn't that
North Korea?

48
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,972
You're trying to sell Harold's
a North Korean product?

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,226
Maybe.

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,731
The North Korea against which
the United States has an embargo?

51
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,280
Now, that embargo is kind
of like Cuba, you know?

52
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,073
It's sort of symbolic.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,197
20 years, Kate. Seen it all.

54
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,361
Right.

55
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,829
Well, maybe not sex
with an octopus. That was a first.

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,994
- That was mine, too.
- Please.

57
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,630
I wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue...

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,792
because I see something
we both share.

59
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,551
A deep love for this school.

60
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,302
Go Falcons.

61
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,507
I wanna do a little
right-brained thinking...

62
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,388
about a left-brain problem.

63
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,343
Are we talking about
the ARB test scores?

64
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,350
I'm talking about empowerment.

65
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,182
I'm saying let's be the change.

66
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,770
Let's not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations.

67
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,404
Um... are you firing me?

68
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,655
- What?
- I'm sorry.

69
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,783
I'm trying to ground floor
the discussions...

70
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,456
so we don't waste our school's
resources on arbitration...

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,953
and severance packages.

72
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,331
Those things threaten the school
that we love.

73
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,253
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

74
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,627
Sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache...

75
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,630
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post.

76
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,337
- You want me to quit?
- No.

77
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,843
That's a personal decision.
What I want doesn't matter.

78
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,549
But I will say this...

79
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,981
I see you flourishing in as slightly
less urban teaching environment...

80
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,979
or perhaps in an
altogether different...

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,561
Can I admit something?

82
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,569
You always have great hair.

83
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,118
Perhaps you'd be happy
cutting hair.

84
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,536
Look, I took this meeting...

85
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,447
because Lucas spoke
highly of you.

86
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,827
He better have.

87
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,168
But I don't think this
is a good fit for Harold's.

88
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,372
- Best of luck.
- Seriously? That's it?

89
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,708
Just because of where
a product's made?

90
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,260
A bit racist, don't you think?

91
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,007
Okay, we're done.

92
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,510
No, you're done.

93
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,433
Because I'll take my business
elsewhere.

94
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,099
- Where's the bathroom?
- Uh, there.

95
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,150
Oh my god. Oh...

96
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,447
What the fuck?
That's my fucking car! Fuck!

97
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,256
- There she is!
- Hey...

98
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,009
- how'd it go?
- Come dance with me!

99
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,717
- What's going on?
- Shake that bony ass of yours!

100
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,982
- What is happening? Did you sell it?
- Party bump!

101
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,605
Meg, did you sell it?

102
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,611
Can we finally get rid of all
these boxes?

103
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,863
Remember all those little
North Korea stickers...

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,322
we peeled off the bottles?

105
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,951
Yeah, of course. There were,
like, 10,000 of them.

106
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,533
Well, it turns out
there's 10,001.

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,661
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

108
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,794
I am totally and thoroughly
fucked.

109
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,802
On the other hand my car
got towed.

110
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,008
- How was your day?
- Meg, it's...

111
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,805
I can't.

112
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,134
I don't even wanna talk
about it.

113
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,014
Wow, how much did you spend?

114
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,813
Oh, I'm gonna bring it back.
But I'm gonna keep some socks.

115
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,026
- How was school?
- Great.

116
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,403
- Moss asked me to quit.
- What?

117
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,990
He thinks that I'd be happier
cutting hair.

118
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,245
Did you point out that
he's bald as fuck?

119
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,377
No, I didn't tell him
he was bald as fuck.

120
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,626
Are you getting fired?

121
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,584
Excuse me.
I gotta get going.

122
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,627
Okay.

123
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,509
- Can I get my clothes?
- Oh, right.

124
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,804
Sorry. I can't seem to...

125
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,226
- Shirt, pants...
- Hi.

126
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,518
- pink underwear...
- Hi.

127
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,395
Nope, that's mine.

128
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,439
Thanks for the lift.

129
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,185
You're gonna give me
a good review, right?

130
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,770
Five stars.

131
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,907
You buy socks and I suck...

132
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,455
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

133
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,330
<i>- Hey, ladies.
- Hey!</i>

134
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,540
<i>What?</i>

135
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,581
- She's back?!
- Oh my god!

136
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,918
- Holy shit.
<i>- How's it going?</i>

137
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,264
That haircut took balls, you
have to hand it to her there.

138
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,807
Are we still drinking?

139
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,805
Hells to the yeah, mothafucka.

140
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,056
Sweet.

141
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,309
<i>I'm 28-years-old, I've had a
lot of success, and I'm ready.</i>

142
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,899
Meg, you're missing the abs.

143
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,398
<i>With whom I spend
the rest of my life.</i>

144
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,479
Why do these girls
play hard to get?

145
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,941
If it was up to me I'd have his
pants around his ankles...

146
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,570
by the first commercial.

147
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,529
Well, it's a game.
They're playing strategy.

148
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,541
<i>Actually satisfy me
on a day-to-day basis.</i>

149
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,786
I actually think I'd be pretty
good on this show.

150
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,874
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're hardly competitive, dear.

151
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,585
You don't have an aggressive
bone in your body.

152
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,175
Against these girls, you'd have
to put on your big-girl pants...

153
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,631
or they'd have you for lunch.

154
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,807
<i>I think I'd describe myself as
definitely thinking outside...</i>

155
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,180
Whatever.

156
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,603
<i>I march to the beat
of my own drum.</i>

157
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,855
<i>A really nice day for me
is wak...</i>

158
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,103
I actually like the whole
construction worker thing.

159
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,809
You know, the whole, like,
works with his hands,

160
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,190
salt-of-the-earth motif.

161
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,818
The only thing salty about him
is his balls.

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,904
- Lovely, Meg.
<i>- Doesn't that just roll off your tongue-</i>

163
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,862
You can have him, if I can have
the fireman from last season.

164
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,993
- Oh, that fireman.
- He was a panty-dropper.

165
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,497
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

166
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,966
And for the record, just because
I don't sleep around...

167
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,215
doesn't mean I couldn't compete
against a group of women...

168
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,922
Did you just take a shot at me?
Was that a drive-by?

169
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,804
You drive-by-ed me.
"Big-girl pants"?

170
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,512
That was a slick move.
She's definitely getting a rose.

171
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,182
<i>I know it's crazy to give out roses
before the first rose ceremony...</i>

172
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,439
<i>- but I don't care.
- Oh my god...</i>

173
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,317
You know, it's been a long day.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

174
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,403
I just opened a new bottle.

175
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,362
- Come on, let's finish it.
- No, I'm going to bed.

176
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,072
No morning re-cap.
I'm watching the rest.

177
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,574
<i>These girls mean nothing to me.</i>

178
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,706
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

179
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,164
Kate?

180
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
- Kate, wake up.
- What, is there a fire?

181
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,922
- No, there's no fire.
- What's wrong? What's going on?

182
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,629
We're screwed up. Our lives,
things aren't going well.

183
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,464
Is it really 4:15?

184
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,221
Remember in the ninth grade when
you got stung by that jellyfish and...

185
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,678
- I peed on you and you got really mad?
- Did you take one of my pills?

186
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,684
You were really mad until it
stopped hurting...

187
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,106
- right?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,229
When you're faced with a
life-threatening problem...

189
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,357
which we are, you step away
from the problem...

190
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,781
and in a calm, adult way,
you self-medicate...

191
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,984
until the solution presents itself.

192
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,193
Okay.

193
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,199
Preferably on a beach
with a margarita.

194
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,625
- Okay, let's talk about it.
- Yes! That's my girl.

195
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,624
- Can we plan this in the morning?
- No, we gotta go.

196
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,333
- What? Where?
- Fort Lauderdale.

197
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,336
- I used your Sky Miles.
- Today?

198
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,793
Now! Our flight's in three hours.

199
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,878
Meg, absolutely not,
that's crazy.

200
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,430
I'm not going on vacation right now.
You're completely insane.

201
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,933
We are going to miss this flight!
This is completely insane!

202
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,888
Why even ask me, if you're gonna
just make us miss the goddamn flight?

203
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,098
- Sir, we can get out here.
- Stop. Stop. Stop!

204
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,023
- Don't yell at the poor guy.
- Thank you, sir.

205
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,352
You pay the driver,
I'll get the bags.

206
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,780
Oh my god. Look at this line!

207
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,781
We are going to miss
this flight!

208
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,655
I cannot believe this.

209
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,612
I kept telling you
that we had to leave.

210
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,868
This happens every single time.
Look at this line!

211
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,167
There's no way we are making this flight.
These are non-refundable tickets.

212
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,869
I told you you can
take a bath...

213
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,125
or you can poach an egg
and not both.

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,548
Meg. Meg. What're you doing?

215
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,380
- Hold on.
- Get in line!

216
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,544
Excuse me.

217
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,629
My friend and I are about
to miss our flight.

218
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,556
Is there any way
we can come in this line?

219
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,884
Are you first class
or an Elite Club member?

220
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,719
We're first-class ladies.

221
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,848
Actually, I think I am
an Elite Club member...

222
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,148
if it didn't expire.

223
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,693
Hold on, let me check.

224
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,775
No, it's not...

225
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,745
Shoot. I guess not.

226
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,414
Sorry about that.

227
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,414
Thanks for your help.
And thanks for keeping us safe.

228
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,295
I just do check-in.

229
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,719
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

230
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,346
It's embarrassing.

231
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,310
Told you.

232
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,031
You can't just cut in front
of all these...

233
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,153
Sorry.

234
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,994
Sorry. Sorry.

235
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,368
Sorry. Sorry.

236
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,917
Oh my god,
you are the sweetest thing.

237
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,790
Don't worry about it.

238
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,041
You hungry?

239
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,543
You could have checked your bag.

240
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,713
I was trying to save some money.

241
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,299
- You okay?
- Yeah.

242
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,680
You got your headphones,
pills, neck pillow...

243
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,017
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be epic.

245
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,520
- Yeah.
- Deep breath.

246
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,896
Ma'am, no liquids
above 3.4 ounces.

247
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,198
You can dispose of it in that
trash can right there.

248
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,901
You want me to get rid of it?
Sure thing.

249
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,047
- It's easier when it's a beer.
- Have a good flight.

250
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,675
Deep breath, girl.

251
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,011
We're going to Florida.
It's gonna be so much fun.

252
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,724
Think of the beach,
think of the sunshine.

253
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,267
Here's your neck pillow.

254
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,897
Six hours in the air.
Up and down.

255
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,321
- Please don't say "down".
- We're still on the ground.

256
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,569
Yeah, I know, but we're
high enough already.

257
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,984
Middle seats are for suckers,
right?

258
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,320
You know what? I actually think
it'd be better if we switched.

259
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,280
I would,
but I need extra legroom.

260
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,741
It's sort of a Gandalf-Bilbo
situation.

261
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,835
- And I'm the hobbit?
- Oh my...

262
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,630
I'm just saying, I'm taller.
Here, take a pill.

263
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,673
- I already took a pill.
- Take another.

264
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,423
Okay.
I'll get you a water.

265
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,129
- No, I don't need any water...
- Excuse me...

266
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,217
can she get a water
so she can take her anti-anxiety pill?

267
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,097
Certainly.

268
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,178
Can we please keep this
to ourselves?

269
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,480
I was just trying to help.
It's not like I gave him your social.

270
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,648
Just quit with the flirty routine,
it's getting really old.

271
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,819
I wasn't. Geez.
Take a deep breath, girl.

272
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,188
I'm surprised you
didn't show him your bra.

273
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,694
I think he might try
and wear it, am I right?

274
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,864
Oh my god.

275
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,787
- Oh my god!
- Soda's coming up.

276
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,661
Oh, Jesus Christ, Meg.

277
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,458
I feel like I am in your intestines.

278
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,080
- Take it.
- Stop it!

279
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,333
- Oh my god!
- I got one more comin', too.

280
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,665
Excuse me. I think
I'm in the middle there.

281
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,144
Thank you.

282
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,404
Hi.

283
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,747
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

284
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,540
Dear lord.

285
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,719
- I'm Meg, by the way.
- Ryan.

286
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,551
So what is it, Ryan?
Business or pleasure?

287
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,386
It's a wedding, actually.

288
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,518
Ah, which can sometimes
feel like work, right?

289
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,895
I feel like last year,
I was at somebody's wedding...

290
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,024
- every other weekend.
- Yeah, they come in waves, don't they?

291
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,320
Yeah.

292
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,320
How about you?
What brings you out?

293
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,367
- I have...
- A girl's trip.

294
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,992
I kinda hate that expression,
but it's true.

295
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,947
We are on a trip and we are girls.

296
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,334
- Okay, so you two are together?
- Yeah, we're best friends.

297
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,163
We're just sitting in these
seats because, you know...

298
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,169
middle seats are for suckers.

299
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,135
Ah, my, uh, reputation
precedes me.

300
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,009
I love weddings.
As long as they're other people's.

301
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,561
- Yeah, that's the truth, right?
- Single ladies in the house.

302
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,354
- I'm Kate, by the way.
- Hey, Ryan. It's good to meet you.

303
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,312
- You too.
- I'm still Meg. Look at us!

304
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,863
Meg Ryan.
We're America's sweetheart.

305
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,274
Do you remember that deli scene?

306
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,032
Yeah, yeah, the, uh,
"I'll have what she's having".

307
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,122
I think that my roommate
is trying to do a scene...

308
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,375
from When Harry Met Slarry.

309
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,340
When Harry Met Smarly.

310
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,211
- When... Smarly Met...
- You okay?

311
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,801
- Is she having a stroke?
- She's fine.

312
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,134
- She's just terrified of flying.
- Smarly... met Marley.

313
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,185
She took some pharmaceuticals.
- Marley...

314
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,353
- Stay there.
- I'm jealous.

315
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,477
It's gonna be all right.

316
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,486
Well, I'll stop bothering you guys.

317
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,404
Oh, you're not bothering...

318
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,370
<i>Hello, folks.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

319
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,324
<i>Hurricane Cindy has headed
toward the Carolinas...</i>

320
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,409
<i>but it looks like she's
taken a bit of a turn...</i>

321
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,790
<i>and now they're re-directing
us to land in St. Louis.</i>

322
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,543
<i>We'll keep you updated as we
receive additional information.</i>

323
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,876
- Oh, man.
- Since when is there a hurricane?

324
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,758
It's... been in the news,
like all week.

325
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,016
I'm not much of a news junkie.
I'm more of a bookworm.

326
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,014
This is just a hate-read.

327
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,145
Excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna need you to...

328
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,272
Oh, god. Really?

329
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,649
Did you need something?

330
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,858
Put your seat up,
and your friend, too, please.

331
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,534
Kate? Kate. Wake up
for the male steward.

332
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,032
It's "flight attendant".
I'm moving her forward.

333
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,659
We're landing soon.

334
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,115
Holy shit.

335
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,707
Is she... is she okay?

336
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,503
Let me just...

337
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,626
We're good. We're good.

338
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,396
Welcome to The Sheraton.

339
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,236
This is the pits.
Fuck you, Cindy.

340
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,038
- Who's Cindy?
- The hurricane.

341
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,450
I dunno, it looks like kinda
good weather for a hurricane.

342
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,207
The hurricane's in Florida,
we're in St. Louis.

343
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,085
Jesus, you took
way too many pills.

344
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,883
Welcome to the St. Louis
Sheraton, I am Anuj.

345
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,630
- How are we today?
- Not good, Anuj.

346
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,596
- The airline says they lost my bag.
- They did? Did they lose mine?

347
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,557
No, they didn't.
You didn't check a bag.

348
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,892
Oh, right, I didn't check a bag.

349
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,225
My apologies, we're tight on space
because of the annual jewelry convention.

350
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,855
Jewelers have conventions?

351
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,655
However, I can put you both
in a lovely junior suite.

352
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,404
Now, while you're here,
please enjoy our four-star restaurant...

353
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,611
pool, spa,
and complimentary shuttle service...

354
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,077
to the majestic St. Louis Arch
and finally, Tut's Tomb...

355
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,533
the number one nightclub
in St. Louis two years running.

356
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,210
For that,
take the elevator down to P1.

357
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,128
That's super, but we're
only here for one night.

358
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,333
Excellent. Well, if you enjoy your stay,
I do hope you'll consider Yelping us.

359
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,138
Oh god. This is what we get
for being spontaneous.

360
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,470
Oh my god, what is that color?

361
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,803
It's not a lipstick,
it's my Lip Lacerater.

362
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,603
Oh, it's fantastic.

363
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,230
Thanks.

364
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,483
Oh, hey, it's my seat mates.

365
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,237
- Good to see you among the living.
- Yeah, thank you.

366
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,110
Okay, I need to go down
one more I think.

367
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,783
I'm gonna work off some travel
frustration at the gym.

368
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,570
- Oh, god, your friend's wedding.
- Yeah, yeah. It's not for a few days.

369
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,122
I was, uh, going down early
for the bachelor party...

370
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,325
but those guys'll be fine.

371
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,582
No natural disaster's gonna stop my buds
from getting embarrassingly drunk.

372
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,294
Hey, um, you guys wanna get
a drink later on tonight?

373
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,800
Might as well
make the best of this, right?

374
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,386
- Yeah. Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

375
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,217
- I like... I like to drink.
- She does.

376
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,599
Not a lot, not to excess, but...

377
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,979
Alcohol.

378
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,768
Cool. How about 8:00?

379
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,185
- Yeah, yeah, it's a date.
- Well, not a date, but a plan.

380
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,898
Yeah.

381
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,731
- Have a good workout.
- Stretch, don't forget!

382
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,486
- Now don't... do gym.
- Don't hurt yourself.

383
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,157
- Oh, not bad.
- And it smells nice, too.

384
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,113
- Not bad at all.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,699
And look at us,
having drinks with a hot guy.

386
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,160
Hey, he's having drinks with us.

387
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,911
Right.

388
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,499
And who knows? Maybe one of us
will hook up, if he's lucky.

389
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,380
He might go for you.

390
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,383
Or you. You're gorgeous,
especially when you're loaded.

391
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,590
I am not, I look like
Mickey Rourke.

392
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,680
Enough with Mickey Rourke.
Why do you always say that?

393
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,186
- It's how I feel.
- Stop it.

394
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,104
You're beautiful.

395
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,771
This is called
"Man Getting Out of Cold Lake".

396
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,153
Thank god I packed my Spanx.

397
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,732
Oh my god, my bag.
Can I borrow a dress?

398
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,944
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I only packed one.

399
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,620
Can I wear it?

400
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,576
No.

401
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,742
- Well, what if you...
- No.

402
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,583
Anuj.
Is there a mall around here?

403
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,338
Can you hold on one second,
please?

404
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,336
- What's that?
- The closest mall?

405
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,338
That would be the Westgate
Pavilion near the arch.

406
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,215
- How far is the arch?
- 30 minutes without traffic.

407
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,389
- Damn it. I need a dress.
- We can call a taxi for you.

408
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,638
- June, will you please call...
- No, I need one now, tonight.

409
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,266
- What would you like me to do?
- Fine.

410
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,849
Sir, are you still there?
Yeah, Okay, so those last three digits...

411
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,934
How do I leave a review on Yelp?

412
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,816
Can you hold on just
one more second, please?

413
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,985
Hey. Wow.

414
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,363
Right?

415
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,369
Where's your other half?

416
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,122
I don't know. Might just be me.

417
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,750
Well, you uh,
you look very nice.

418
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,925
Thank you. I didn't pack too much
'cause it's really just a girl's trip...

419
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,003
but I thought, you know,
I'd try something with what I have...

420
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,838
Holy shit.

421
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,598
- You look amazing.
- You like it?

422
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,272
- I wasn't sure I could pull it off.
- No, no. You look great.

423
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,021
Meg's an expert
at pulling off a dress.

424
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,024
Okay, uh, let me go see
if I can snag us a booth.

425
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,774
- Where did you get that?
- The Indian dude at the front desk.

426
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,280
His mom loaned it to me.
Crazy, right?

427
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,576
That is so crazy.

428
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,658
Hey there, you ladies
here for Jewel Con?

429
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,911
No, uh, we're just...
we're meeting some friends.

430
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,415
Yes, yes, you are... us.
<i>Namaste.</i>

431
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,042
I'm Craig, precious gems
are my specialty.

432
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,341
Chuck here is in, uh,
high-end watch repair.

433
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,384
Shahar does imports.

434
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,758
"Shahar" is Hebrew
for "sunrise"...

435
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,932
which you will experience
tomorrow morning in my bed.

436
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,723
- That was smooth. Very smooth.
- She didn't refuse, that's good.

437
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,559
- Yeah, well...
- I have cocaine.

438
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,639
Whoa, Chuck, put it away.

439
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,602
He's very excited he has cocaine.
He's been showing it to everybody.

440
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,233
I smuggled it on the plane
in my underpants.

441
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,274
Enough about us,
and you guys are...?

442
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,236
Undercover federal agents
investigating a counterfeit diamond ring.

443
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,868
So you can either step aside
and let us do our job...

444
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,495
or I'll give Kate here the green light
to shove her taser in your ass...

445
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,623
- and light you up.
- Okay, sorry, officers.

446
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,253
Let's go.

447
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,682
Hey. I glommed on to
some fellow travelers.

448
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,389
This is Roger and Nancy,
Kate and Meg.

449
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,646
Oh my god, you look like
a fucking princess.

450
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,318
Thanks, it's a sari.

451
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,112
Honey, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

452
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,236
Roger and Nancy are celebrating
their anniversary.

453
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,989
Ten years
and I think I'll keep her.

454
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,660
- That's sweet.
- Shit.

455
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,200
Category four?

456
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,378
- So much for losing steam.
- No one's getting out of here tomorrow.

457
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,664
I'm not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner.

458
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,250
Oh, come on,
don't think like that.

459
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,882
Yeah, hurricanes are
notoriously unpredictable.

460
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,590
That's why they name them
after women, right?

461
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,767
It was a slam-dunk case,
see this guy didn't have a prayer...

462
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,266
but he did have this gorgeous
defense attorney.

463
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,848
Gorgeous and <i>gifted</i>
defense attorney.

464
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,684
- All charges were dropped.
- Well, not entirely...

465
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,818
I did manage to negotiate
into the plea bargain...

466
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,771
that Nancy go on a date with me.

467
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,859
First time in my career,
I got two men off in one day.

468
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,160
More than once, as I recall.

469
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,580
- I could have you dis-barred, you know?
- Yeah? I could have you mounted.

470
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,874
- I'll mount you.
- Did you bring the cuffs?

471
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,917
- I'll blindfold you first.
- Oh, interrogation.

472
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,665
Or Q & A?

473
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,172
I think we lost them.

474
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,296
What about you guys?
What do you do?

475
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,298
I'm a CEO.

476
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,847
- Wow.
- I sell a line of skin care products.

477
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,720
You know Michelle Obama?

478
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,176
Is she a client?

479
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:25,014
Well, obviously I can't talk about it...
but how about her skin?

480
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,316
Damn. Damn.
What about you, Kate?

481
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,569
I'm a teacher...
I teach high school.

482
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,987
Oh, nice.

483
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,983
Special needs high school.

484
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,114
Wow. Is that hard?

485
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,242
You know what's hard is not
being with them right now.

486
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,791
A lot of people think that
I teach them... but...

487
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,914
but really, you know,
they teach me.

488
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,370
Yeah.

489
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,206
The blind teach me
how to listen better...

490
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,462
and the mute teach me...

491
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:58,263
you know, not to talk so much,
so I'm gonna stop.

492
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,929
Man, I can't compete with you two.

493
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,431
I'm just a firefighter.

494
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,641
<i>All right, what's up,
everybody? Come on.</i>

495
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,310
Eh-yo, this is DJ Spooj,
rhymes with Anuj...

496
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,818
'cause we both gonna be on
your face by the end of the night.

497
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,238
<i>All the junkies in the house say "ho".</i>
- Ho!

498
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,615
<i>All the wacky knickers
in the house say "eh-yo".</i>

499
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,911
Eh-yo!

500
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,866
<i>All right, let's get to it.
Have a good night, everybody.</i>

501
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,378
- You guys wanna dance?
- Who me?

502
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,732
If you're having a good time.
You guys know what to do.

503
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,404
Yelp us.

504
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,279
Oh shit, let's get a muh-fuckin
dance circle up in here!

505
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,110
Show DJ Spooj what you got!

506
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,955
Meg! Hey!
Your boob is hanging out!

507
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,048
Got it.

508
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,307
How long was it out?

509
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,439
20 seconds.

510
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,519
That's the length of a fucking
Geico commercial.

511
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,230
You know, I'm impressed anyone could
have upstaged that flight attendant.

512
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,781
Well, this is you, guys.

513
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,913
I had a...
I had a really good time tonight.

514
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,787
Yeah, me too...
despite, you know...

515
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,502
- Night.
- Night.

516
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,173
Hey.

517
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,424
- Yeah?
- What's up?

518
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,502
You know, since we're gonna be
stuck here tomorrow...

519
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,713
it may be nice to see the city.

520
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,345
Maybe get a little crazy, buy a
St. Louis magnet for the fridge?

521
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,472
- Yeah, I actually need a magnet.
- I have a fridge.

522
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,179
Great. Let's just connect
in the morning then.

523
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,640
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

524
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,350
Hey, you know what?
I, uh, I'm actually gonna ride up with you.

525
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,982
The, uh, the ice machine
on our floor is broken, so...

526
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,779
- Oh.
- What do you need ice for?

527
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,448
- Ice water.
- Wait, you can't go.

528
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,152
- I need you to open our door.
- We... we both have keys.

529
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,703
I left mine in the room.

530
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,280
- I think that's the bell...
- Well here, whatever...

531
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,785
you can just take mine.

532
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,118
You know what?
I'll just go with you.

533
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,669
Don't be silly, you don't need
two people to get ice.

534
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,587
I just thought it would be
easier for you.

535
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,756
Elevator's closing,
good luck with the ice, guys.

536
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,958
- Oh, goodnight!
- Goodnight!

537
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,377
Ice? Really?

538
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,679
- At least I didn't pull my boob out.
- Do you think I did that on purpose?

539
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,341
- I know that you did. You have great tits.
- That's insane!

540
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,222
Listen, I know you wanna
do your thing...

541
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,929
- Not the great tits part.
- But I actually like him.

542
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,265
Well, I love him.

543
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,019
- You love him?
- Yes, I love him.

544
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,227
- You don't even know his last name.
- So?

545
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,608
Do Romeo and Juliet
know each other's last name?

546
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,440
Yes! Montague and Capulet.

547
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,493
Oh, I'm an English teacher.

548
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,945
I want him.

549
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,206
Not this time.

550
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,751
You want me to choose?

551
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,749
Whichever,
we're totally cool with it.

552
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,671
Yeah, totally. I'm cool, too.

553
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,502
Well, I mean, they say the
St. Louis art museum's pretty great...

554
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,303
but what a day to hit
the botanical gardens, right?

555
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,257
Or door number three.

556
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,763
Boom! A hot air balloon ride!

557
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,061
- Now that is rad.
- A balloon?

558
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,605
He said he wanted to see the city.
This way he can see all of it.

559
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,559
Aw, man, this seems way more fun
than paintings and plants.

560
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,819
Yeah well, you know,
it's not just paintings, it's...

561
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,067
it's furniture and sculptures...

562
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,691
Oh, I forgot your fear of heights.

563
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,073
Oh... oh, we don't have to
do the balloon ride.

564
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,450
Oh, no, I know.
How about you hit the museum...

565
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,452
Ryan and I will go
in the balloon...

566
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,078
and then we can all meet up
for dinner later.

567
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,412
- Yeah, if you're scared of flying.
- No, I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

568
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,544
It's just airplanes, so I'll go.
I'm going.

569
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,627
- You sure?
- Yeah, absolutely. It'll be an adventure.

570
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,630
All right then... go ballooning.

571
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,589
The ride should last
about an hour.

572
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,305
My brother will follow us
in the chase car.

573
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,762
Make sure all personal
belongings are secure.

574
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,439
Also, for the lovers, we have
cold champagne for purchase.

575
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,517
Okay, any questions?

576
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,605
Um, I don't mean to be rude,
but can you see?

577
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:53,194
Uh, don't worry, ma'am.
I, uh, see just fine.

578
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,372
Just messing with you.
All right then.

579
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,408
Let's touch the sky!

580
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,378
Here we go!

581
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,892
Yeah!

582
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,611
Wow. Beautiful, isn't it?

583
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,246
St. Louis doesn't look so bad
from up here.

584
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,324
It's pretty spectacular, right?

585
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,330
Yeah, it's really great.

586
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,127
You okay?
You're sweating.

587
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,798
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm just... I'm really hot.

588
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,173
It'll be nice and cool when we
hit about 2,000 feet.

589
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,346
- How high are we right now?
- 500.

590
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,767
You, uh, you sure you're okay?

591
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,727
Yes, yes, yes.

592
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,183
No, no, no, no, no!
You get me down right now!

593
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,859
Get me down right now!

594
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,107
Ma'am, ma'am, we gotta go
up to catch the current.

595
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,734
Fuck the fucking current!

596
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,532
- I think she's having a panic attack.
- Oh, great.

597
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,985
She's fine.

598
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,241
Breathe. Breathe.

599
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,371
Find your breath. Look at me.
Find your breath.

600
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,750
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to disappoint you.

601
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,832
Now let's take my hands,
stare into my eyes.

602
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,883
They're... so beautiful.

603
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,837
Like... like a... robin's egg.

604
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,180
Let's sing a song,
you and me, okay?

605
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,522
Is that Pink?

606
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,648
I don't know, it was the first
song that came to my head.

607
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,026
- I kinda like her.
- I like her, too.

608
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,529
- Ready?
- Yeah.

609
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,194
- Oh, jeez.
- Gosh, this is fun.

610
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,574
This is so fucking fun.

611
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,375
- Jeez.
- How much for the champagne?

612
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,498
$100 with tax.
I take credit cards.

613
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,171
Are you insane?
That's a $20 bottle of brut.

614
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,295
You're welcome to shop around.

615
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,924
I'll take the fucking champagne.

616
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,427
Look who has bubbly.

617
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,306
Let's drink some champagne and
really take in this view.

618
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,434
You know, I'm not sure alcohol
is a good idea for her right now.

619
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,062
I wasn't talking about her.
She's fine.

620
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,189
This happens all the time.

621
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,896
Oh, you should go and have fun.

622
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,323
Hey, I am having fun.

623
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,410
Me, too. So much fun.

624
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,829
- Oh, shit! Shit!
- My eye!

625
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,872
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

626
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,919
- Did you hit him in his good eye?
- She hit me in my only eye!

627
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,086
What?!

628
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,255
Here, let me take a look,
let me take a look.

629
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,083
- Is it bad? I can't see.
- Yeah, you got a small cut.

630
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,919
- Oh god, he's crying blood!
- Your pupil is red.

631
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,549
- I don't think it's too serious.
- Shit! Shit!

632
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,339
- There's a little bit of blood.
- Oh my god we're gonna die!

633
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,221
Everybody calm down!
No one's going to die!

634
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,428
We're just gonna have to land
a little early, okay?

635
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,228
- Okay.
- Okay.

636
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,980
Now, I just gotta ask:
has anybody ever piloted...

637
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,231
a hot air balloon before?

638
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,154
What?

639
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,359
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Calm down! It's gonna be all right!

640
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,626
- Are you okay?
- No!

641
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,084
Oh my god! Oh my god!

642
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,672
Can somebody call
for an ambulance?

643
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,388
Please! Please be quiet!

644
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,634
Shut the fuck up!

645
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,554
Please! Oh my god! Oh my god!

646
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,307
<i>Que pasa?</i>

647
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,195
Hey, how was the balloon ride?
Nice view of the arch, right?

648
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,446
It was great.

649
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,870
I have some good news
from the airlines.

650
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,492
The flight's back on?

651
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,324
No, they found your bag.
I'm so sorry, I should have led with that.

652
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,250
Yes! Thank you, Anuj.

653
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,545
Well, shall we celebrate
being alive?

654
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,338
Honestly, I think
I'm just gonna relax.

655
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,633
I'm gonna go upstairs,
call Florida, maybe hit the pool.

656
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,341
- Oh, I'll join you! I love the pool.
- I'll come with you.

657
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,547
Now that I have a suitcase,
I don't have to go naked.

658
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,590
Maybe I'll just go naked.

659
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,146
Oh my god, I hate myself.

660
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,352
I think I'm ready.

661
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,318
Oh, cute suit.

662
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,150
I'll see you by the pool.

663
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,304
Lacerater.

664
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,778
Can I get two Mai Tai's
over here?

665
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,703
Hey!

666
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,168
This is amazing.

667
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,665
You've got to try it.

668
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,464
It looks very inviting.

669
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,917
I was actually wondering if
you're not doing anything later-

670
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,425
First, I wasn't talking to you,
and second, it's not gonna happen, okay?

671
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,422
Um, this is closed.

672
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,348
And it's not what you think,
that you're not hot enough...

673
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,426
because you're totally hot enough.

674
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,931
I've dated way lower.

675
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,476
This seat is taken.

676
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,729
Guys, leave the seat
next to Meg open.

677
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,439
Come on, scoot.

678
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,861
There you go.

679
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,952
- Seriously? What are you doing?
- Yeah, I don't know.

680
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,119
Hey!

681
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,792
Hey, Ryan!
Look, I snagged us a chair.

682
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,001
Oh my god.
Oh, Jesus mother fu...

683
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,674
Oh... oh my god.
Oh my god, oh...

684
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,298
I think I might just
lay out for a bit.

685
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,392
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

686
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,144
Stop.

687
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,858
See, this is a definition
of "cock block".

688
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,659
I'm really sorry about today.

689
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,704
Thank you so much. I'm really...
I'm embarrassed.

690
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,578
Embarrassed?
I'm the one that sang Pink.

691
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,118
I have the feeling that
that's not the first time...

692
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,794
that you've sang that out loud.

693
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,337
No comment.

694
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,710
Wanna take a dip?

695
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,545
Um, actually I think we're
just gonna hang out here...

696
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,091
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind swimming.
- Yeah, me, too. I'd love to do that.

697
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,841
I'll come, too.

698
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,015
- You don't see that much.
- What?

699
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,850
A hotel pool
you can actually dive in.

700
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,639
We love diving!

701
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,901
- We used to go every summer at your...
- At my dad's houseboat!

702
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,479
You were so nervous to jump
in at first, remember?

703
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,155
You told me there were
piranhas in the lake...

704
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,608
and it freaked me out...
that was so mean of you.

705
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,739
You're just mad 'cause
I always beat you at diving.

706
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,287
That's 'cause your dad was the judge.
I would have won with an impartial jury.

707
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,785
- I was so much better than you.
- That's funny.

708
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,292
Well, you got one now.

709
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:51,508
Okay, let's start with the basics.
Jack knife.

710
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,602
You call that a jack knife?
That was more like a belly flop.

711
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,975
And deduct points for splash,
that's the Olympic rules.

712
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,272
Got it.

713
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,567
Now, a jack knife...
the right way.

714
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,727
Whoa.

715
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,905
Oh, shit.

716
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,656
Impartial judge gives you
a five... both of you.

717
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,572
Time to step it up, back flip.

718
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,331
Go on, do it.

719
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,500
Okay!

720
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,083
Nice!

721
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,713
That was your best back flip?

722
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,223
What're you doing?

723
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,806
Forward one-and-a-half tuck.

724
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,358
What? What is that?

725
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,439
Are you crazy?
That is so dangerous.

726
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,819
- Still scared, I guess.
- No, I'm not scared. It's gonna kick out.

727
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,323
Okay, fine, go ahead, go ahead,
do what you want.

728
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,325
Front one-and-a-half tuck.

729
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,957
Oh my god.

730
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,005
That hurts.

731
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,376
Meg? Meg, are you all right?

732
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,759
Why are you just sitting
down there? Are you okay?

733
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,848
Meg? Are you coming up?

734
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,186
Meg, are you alive? Meg!

735
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,541
Hi.

736
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:50,956
Hey.

737
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,960
Are we drinking?

738
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,596
She'll have a Screwdriver.

739
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,226
Not so much ice.
Just three cubes.

740
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,685
Are you okay?

741
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,859
Yeah.

742
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,360
Actually, no. I think I
turned my eyelid inside out.

743
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,316
Oh, there's my girls.

744
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,401
Can I have two Tequila Sunrises?

745
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,031
Did you hear the weather report?

746
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,954
They said that the hurricane
has passed through...

747
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,909
so you two might get a little
beach time after all.

748
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,625
Great.

749
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,911
Ah, great.

750
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,213
Yeah, a few days of a time share
isn't as good as a week...

751
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,417
but you know,
I'll take what I can get.

752
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,507
I'm not gonna see Roger
again for a month.

753
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,339
- Is he traveling?
- Back to the wife and kids.

754
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,393
- Thank you.
- I-I'm sorry, back to where?

755
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,687
Roger's married, just not to me.

756
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,434
You were celebrating
your anniversary.

757
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,685
Of a love affair.

758
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,107
Fuck you, don't judge me.

759
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,279
'Cause I don't like that.
'Cause let me tell you something.

760
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,655
I am a lady
who demands perfection, okay?

761
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,737
Is it fair to his wife? No.
Is it fair to his kids?

762
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,287
No.

763
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,706
I don't care.

764
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,580
Because I would do anything
for Roger.

765
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,540
I would die for that man.

766
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,421
- Wow.
- It's true. I'd kill for him.

767
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,879
I'd kill his family,
I'd kill his wife.

768
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,336
Anybody got in my way, I'd kill 'em.
Right there. Kill 'em.

769
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,671
I'd kill you, I'd kill you,
I'd kill everyone.

770
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,054
And I know how to do it, too,
'cause my brother's a Navy Seal.

771
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,269
- I'm just kidding!
- Oh...

772
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,063
It was a joke.
But seriously, you know?

773
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,362
Sometimes you just gotta
take what you want, whatever the cost.

774
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,656
Because at the end of the day,
nobody gives a shit...

775
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,325
whether you're happy or not,
you know what I'm sayin'?

776
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,574
You can put their drinks
on my tab.

777
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,957
Thanks for everything, guys.

778
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,212
- Ryan!
- Ryan!

779
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,918
- No, no, no!
- Wait! Wait up!

780
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,507
- Oh, hey!
- There he is.

781
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,932
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

782
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,386
I, uh, was actually
looking for you two.

783
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,687
Oh, well,
look and you shall find.

784
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,894
Yeah, I wanted to see you guys
before I left.

785
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,351
There's my road buddy.
Hey.

786
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,152
- Ladies.
- Hi.

787
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,729
- How's your eye, Meg?
- It's fine.

788
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,190
- It looks a little...
- You're leaving now?

789
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,820
Yeah, didn't you see
the weather report?

790
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,867
Our flight's gonna be back
on any moment.

791
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,116
I'm out of time. I just,
you know, can't take the chance.

792
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,698
If we drive through the night,
I can get you to Fort by morning.

793
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,998
What fort?

794
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,042
Oh, local speak,
Fort Lauderdale.

795
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,667
You're going on a road trip
with a complete stranger?

796
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,545
He could be a serial killer
for all you know.

797
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,250
I'm not a serial killer.

798
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,007
That's exactly what
a serial killer would say.

799
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,339
You're something, you know that?
Let's hit the road.

800
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,642
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Serial killer. That's great.

801
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,928
Awesome meeting you both.

802
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,847
- Bye.
- Bye.

803
00:44:58,905 --> 00:44:59,895
All right.

804
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,065
Yeah, okay.

805
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,745
- Bye.
- Wait!

806
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,291
- Got room for one more?
- Oh, shit.

807
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,912
I'll just be one minute.

808
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,079
Hey, you know what?
Make that... make that two!

809
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,130
I'll be right back, okay?

810
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,507
I can't help it.
I love fucked up women.

811
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,561
I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

812
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,896
A little company,
a little conversation.

813
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,898
Usually I'd just be
blasting my tunes.

814
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,775
Uh, by the way, are you guys
on Google Plus?

815
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,276
- No.
- No, I'm on Tinder.

816
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,734
Well, get on it. We should all
be in each other's circles.

817
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,945
- How long is the drive?
- Oh, it'll be no time at all.

818
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,450
I know all the back ways.
Uh, 17 hours?

819
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,042
I've got a million songs on this thing,
so we're all covered on music.

820
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:59,122
Right now we're listening
to the "south on I-24 mix".

821
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,206
Please wait four songs
before complaining.

822
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,880
This is gonna be fun.
Seven hours, no sweat.

823
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,507
Seventeen.

824
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,803
Oh.

825
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,968
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

826
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,272
a banana, an egg, a frog,
a um...

827
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,190
griffon, a haberdasher,

828
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,566
an icicle, a jackalope,
and a knight.

829
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,772
Ha! It was "k",
and you're an English teacher!

830
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,948
No, it is "k", it's "k",
like a knight in shining armor.

831
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,617
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

832
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,412
a banana, a Chihuahua,
a dolphin, an egg, a frog...

833
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,240
a griffon, a haberdasher,
an icicle, a jackalope...

834
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,325
a knight, and a labradoodle.

835
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,377
- Meg, it's your turn!
- Nice work!

836
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,126
Okay, I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I hate this fucking game.

837
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,924
- Gin.
- Son of a bitch.

838
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,427
- You know what? I wanna sit in the back.
- I'd hate me, too.

839
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,474
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no switching!
- It's my turn!

840
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,144
- No, no, hey, hey, no switching!
- What're you doing?

841
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,347
- Get back in the front.
- Just get right there.

842
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,649
Go, so I can sit here!

843
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,226
- What're you doing?
- It's my turn!

844
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,190
- Hey.
- Thank you.

845
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,070
They always put
too much ice in this.

846
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,203
Ah, what're you doing?

847
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,000
Come on.

848
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:32,139
Oh my god. Oh my god,
did you seriously do that?

849
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,808
That is disgusting.

850
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,635
- Oh my god. Open the window!
- Come on, dude!

851
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,766
For God's sakes!
That is disgusting!

852
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,384
- It smells nice.
- It's lavender.

853
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,717
It's great for dry skin.
Not that you have any.

854
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,595
Feels good.

855
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,356
Minerals, essential vitamins,
and extracts.

856
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,024
Also a shit ton of honey.

857
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,148
It's like sticking your hand
in a beehive.

858
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,149
Careful, don't get stung.

859
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,315
Oh my god.

860
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,025
- What?
- It's from Meg's mom.

861
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,076
I texted her to wish her
a happy birthday and...

862
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,323
It's not her birthday.

863
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,201
She sent me this photo of when
we were in high school.

864
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,577
What photo?

865
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,409
Oh my god.
When is this from?

866
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,666
- It's, uh, prom.
- What is that on your head?

867
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,797
- It's um... It's a helmet.
- It's nothing, it's just a hat.

868
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,376
- It's a protective helmet... for her skull.
- Uh, may I see?

869
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,461
Oh, yeah,
my nephew had one of those...

870
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,389
when he was three and a half months old,
'cause his head was shaped like...

871
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,512
a zucchini and they were
trying to reshape it.

872
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,099
- Was your head shaped like a zucchini?
- No, I just had migraines.

873
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,556
She had this really rare condition.
It was, um, what was it?

874
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,108
- It was complex...
- Complex chiari malformation.

875
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,982
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
Malformation. It was horrible.

876
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,938
The kids just called her
horrible names.

877
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,070
She wore the thing for six
months. It was terrible.

878
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,572
That sucks. Man, kids can
be so mean, you know?

879
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,948
Yeah.

880
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,283
Scrotum head.

881
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,078
Reservoir tip.
Captain Retard.

882
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,004
Soft-skull Smurf...

883
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,548
It was horrible.
I just tried to be there for her, though.

884
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,295
No matter what the kids
called her.

885
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,377
Well, she's lucky to have you
as a friend.

886
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,340
I actually feel really lucky
because her struggles...

887
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,177
really, they inspired me to...
to teach special needs kids...

888
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,682
so... so, thank you, Meg.

889
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,309
Oh yeah.

890
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,395
Scrotum head...
That's pretty good.

891
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,673
- I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
- You guys want something to drink?

892
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,757
- I'm buyin'.
- Oh, I'm good.

893
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,098
Oh, I'm good, too.

894
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,350
Oh... hi.

895
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,567
- Hi, how are you today?
- Oh, not bad.

896
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,365
Oh, yeah, thank you.

897
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,988
Oh my god.

898
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,785
Oh my god.

899
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,090
Oh god.

900
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,948
Occupied!

901
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,052
Okay.

902
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,605
Meg, is that you?

903
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,687
It's Scrotum head, bitch.

904
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,983
Hello?

905
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:02,526
Hello? There's an unsafe
level of feces in here!

906
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,326
Hey.

907
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,082
Listen, Kate may be a while.
She's having an issue.

908
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,586
Everything okay?

909
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,462
Unusually heavy flow.
Don't say anything.

910
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,215
I would normally never tell you,
but she'd be mortified...

911
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,262
if everyone thought
it was the diarrhea.

912
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,431
That's mostly cleared up.

913
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,555
Okay, well, we'll just wait.

914
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,899
Look what I got,
the most expensive of the two.

915
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,271
Good idea.

916
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,589
It's crazy, isn't it?

917
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,096
We've only known each other
for a few days...

918
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:09,142
and yet I feel like
I've known you my whole life.

919
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,219
Well, you know,
we've been stopping a lot.

920
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,933
We'll pick up the pace.
You know...

921
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,016
Sorry, I gotta take this.
Hey, you maniac!

922
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,192
Yeah, yeah man,
I'm just outside Valdosta...

923
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,145
I should be getting
in about 10:00.

924
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,447
Yeah. You guys having fun?

925
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,658
Get... Fucking bumblebee!

926
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,362
- Jesus.
- Everyone wants a bite of that guy.

927
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,492
There's not really honey
in the hand cream.

928
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,324
Hey. Yeah, uh, sorry. No.

929
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,251
- Gassed up and ready to roll.
- Good for you.

930
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,045
Where's Kate? We should hit it.

931
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,918
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

932
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,999
I just thought we were trying
to make it to a wedding.

933
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,800
That's why I've been speeding
the whole time.

934
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,549
67? That's your idea
of speeding?

935
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,517
Traditionally, when someone
does you a favor, you say "thank you".

936
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,264
Well, I'm a rebel.

937
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,516
Just keep me posted.
Okay, buddy.

938
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,264
Ryan!

939
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,935
Ryan, is everything okay?

940
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,862
Uh, yeah, yeah.
These guys are animals.

941
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,781
- We'll leave it at that.
- Awesome.

942
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,782
Anyway, I was thinking,
I'm not gonna have much to do.

943
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,489
Kate's obsessed with looking
for shells on the beach...

944
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:16,497
so after you finish the wedding stuff
and maybe you wanna hook up...

945
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,671
or even if you need a date,
I brought a dress.

946
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,339
It's really more...

947
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,674
Oh my god!

948
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,506
- Are you okay? What happened?
- What happened?!

949
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,180
Someone locked me in the bathroom!
That's what happened!

950
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,263
- Why? Who would do that?
- That homeless guy.

951
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,314
You know what?
I smelled meth on him.

952
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,767
Guys, what is taking so...
Oh my god!

953
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,818
Are... are you okay?

954
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,566
Oh... you got something on your...

955
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,904
Where are we?

956
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,452
I think that's poop.

957
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,502
Don't touch me!

958
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,079
I wasn't going to.

959
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,717
Motherfucker!

960
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,551
Oh my god!

961
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,365
- Oh, god.
- You okay?

962
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,080
Yeah, it's just... my neck.

963
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,374
I think I tweaked it
when I fell.

964
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,077
- Here, come here.
- Oh yeah, sure. Thank you.

965
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,421
- Right here?
- Yeah.

966
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,874
Here, just... right there.

967
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,557
Oh yeah.

968
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,094
Oh god yeah, right there...

969
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,523
Oh, oh my god, that is so good.

970
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,020
Yeah, you got a big knot
right here.

971
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,400
Oh yeah.
Oh! That's awesome.

972
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,607
Jesus, you two, get a room.

973
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,112
Finally.

974
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,617
Sorry you hurt your neck.

975
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,620
Yeah, I bet you are.

976
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,202
I am. Want a sip?

977
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,208
It might help loosen
up your neck.

978
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,298
- No, thank you.
- Nah, me neither.

979
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,547
That's what I get for traveling
with a bunch of stiffs.

980
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,217
What're you doing? Stop!

981
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:38,051
- You don't know me.
- I know you're the driver.

982
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,772
I thought you were a rebel.

983
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,867
- How much do you weigh?
- What?

984
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,121
You've been driving for a while.
Want me to tap in?

985
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,790
Look, I'm on the road like six,
seven days a month.

986
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,084
A haul like this
is nothing to me.

987
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,958
Just get some sleep.
Everything's fine.

988
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,066
Are you insane?!

989
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,320
Okay! We're okay. We're okay.
What'd that sign say?

990
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,719
Are you insane?

991
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,682
I'm screwed, man.
I'm really fucking screwed.

992
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:08,062
- I'm not gonna make the wedding.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are, bucko.

993
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,979
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

994
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,268
Oh.

995
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,151
Oh, geez, I feel weird.

996
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:17,484
- Help you?
- Yeah...

997
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,114
the, uh, headlamps
are out on our car.

998
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,865
- Is there a garage in town?
- Yeah.

999
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,822
You think the guy could open up
and maybe take a look?

1000
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,158
- Oh, no, I doubt it.
- Can we rent a car?

1001
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,834
- Sure.
- Now?

1002
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,287
- Oh, oh, no. Not tonight.
- Tomorrow?

1003
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,214
- How long will it take us to get a car?
- I ate one of those um...

1004
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,837
Well, it'd have to come
from the airport.

1005
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,759
- I think they open around 8:00.
- Uh, you know.

1006
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,382
Would they deliver it here?

1007
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,055
I don't know. Maybe. No.

1008
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,345
Can we borrow your car?

1009
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,393
- It was at the gas station...
- No.

1010
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,438
- And when you don't use bread...
- Okay, well, shit.

1011
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,187
Nothing we can do tonight.
Uh, we'll take two rooms.

1012
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,643
I think it starts with a "T".

1013
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,945
Uh, three rooms, actually.
I'd like my own room.

1014
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,148
- Three rooms.
- Okay, even if we cab it to the airport...

1015
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,358
we could be on the road
by maybe 9:30-10:00.

1016
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,695
There you go. This one's out the door,
up the stairs, to the right.

1017
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,080
There's a restaurant out back
towards the interstate.

1018
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,123
- You can walk it.
- All right.

1019
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,667
It's... open 'til 10:00.

1020
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,920
I'm wanna get this guy in bed.

1021
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,043
I'll, uh, park the car later on.

1022
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,420
You know, for food poisoning,
this ain't bad.

1023
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,676
Goodnight.

1024
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,017
See ya.

1025
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,313
Yeah.

1026
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,149
He's yours, okay? He's yours.

1027
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,859
I don't want him.

1028
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,283
I just didn't want you
to have him.

1029
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,464
Oh, hey.

1030
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,084
Don't be so excited.

1031
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,423
Where's Ryan?

1032
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,179
On the phone, wedding stuff,
thought I'd give him some space.

1033
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,768
You okay?

1034
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,352
Yeah. Yeah.
Just got quite the buzz going on.

1035
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,354
Thought some alcohol
would add nicely to it.

1036
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,902
Hey, can I get a shot of Turkey?
Thanks.

1037
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,363
I'm gonna go play some pool.

1038
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,490
You can sit next to me.

1039
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,072
You sure?
I don't wanna give you cooties.

1040
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,670
Look at that handsome guy
with that hag.

1041
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,631
Two smiles in one night.
I'm on my game.

1042
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,394
Finally getting your ice.

1043
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,516
I hate ice, it hurts my teeth.

1044
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,187
Oh.

1045
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,395
Where's, uh...

1046
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,482
She's at the bar.
She's probably waiting for you.

1047
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,117
Goodnight.

1048
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,660
Wait.

1049
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,957
What're you doing?

1050
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,873
You two were always together.

1051
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,249
I'm gonna kiss your mouth now.

1052
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:20,916
Okay.

1053
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,522
Wow.

1054
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,025
Oh, I know. It's crooked.

1055
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,271
- Was it, like, an accident or something?
- No, no, just kinda born that way.

1056
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,072
I've been told that
it enhances the experience.

1057
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,650
Right.

1058
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,782
All right, here we go!
Here we go!

1059
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,334
Oh, it's good, isn't it?

1060
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,874
Mary, mother of God!

1061
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:02,041
- You okay?
- Yeah, just gonna do one thing.

1062
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,756
Okay. Oh, shit. That's okay.

1063
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,634
Here, let me just try...
Oh yeah, that's better!

1064
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,392
You okay?

1065
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,394
You know,
we don't have to do this.

1066
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,644
Yes. We. Do.

1067
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,569
Oh! Here we go!

1068
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,710
Yes!

1069
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,665
Long story short,
that is how I became a jeweler.

1070
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,627
Screw you, Dad. Right?

1071
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,844
Okay.

1072
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,846
I give up.

1073
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,470
What?

1074
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:01,067
You know, I carry all kinds
of gemstones in my store.

1075
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,644
Hundreds.

1076
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,230
Precious, semi-precious,
uncut, faceted.

1077
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,653
Every time a woman walks
into my store...

1078
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,360
all she wants is one thing...
diamonds.

1079
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,411
Don't get me wrong,
I love diamonds...

1080
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,865
but there are so many other
stones out there...

1081
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,326
with such amazing qualities.

1082
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,209
Imperial jade, the texture
of a jacinth stone...

1083
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,792
the way, if you add just the
smallest amount of iron to amethyst...

1084
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,924
it produces the truest shade
of violet you've ever seen.

1085
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,846
I'm the imperial jade,
in case that wasn't clear.

1086
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,728
- No, I got it.
- All right, too much bourbon.

1087
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,185
Gotta go. 'Night.

1088
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,320
Spear of butter, a little bit
of cinnamon on a King's Hawaiian...

1089
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,322
is the ultimate comfort food.

1090
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,119
- Hi.
- Hey.

1091
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,823
- Mind if I join you?
- Shut up.

1092
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,454
This raisin bran is amazing,
by the way. You should get some.

1093
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,080
What's with you?

1094
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,625
Nothing.

1095
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,416
We have to stop. This is insane.

1096
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,252
You're the most important person
in my life.

1097
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:11,838
You know that, right?

1098
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,425
I'm not gonna throw that away
for some doofus.

1099
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,509
I mean, geez, right?

1100
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:21,268
He's cute and everything,
but there's not much more there...

1101
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,442
than killer abs and a bent dick.
Look into young Ryan's eyes...

1102
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,814
and I have serious doubt that
there's anyone home.

1103
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,862
There you guys are.
I was knocking on your doors.

1104
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,656
- Not now, Craig.
- Ryan's gone.

1105
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,988
- What?
- Yeah, he stole my car.

1106
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,319
Are you serious?

1107
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,199
What is the matter with you?

1108
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,701
- What's the matter with you?!
- You told me that I could have him!

1109
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,579
That is what you said to me
and then you went and you...

1110
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,251
- slept with him anyway?!
- No, I...

1111
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,794
How do you know he has
a bent dick?!

1112
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,496
- What?!
- You slept with Ryan.

1113
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,416
You are unbelievable, Meg.
I am done with you!

1114
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,968
- I am so done...
- Wait a second, we are not done...

1115
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,715
and how do you know
he has a bent dick?

1116
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,799
Because I spent the night
with him, Einstein!

1117
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,430
Whoa, whoa!

1118
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,394
- That was a kill shot!
- What?

1119
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,349
I take Krav Maga at the Y!
That was a straight up kill shot!

1120
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:08,607
You took a fucking kill shot at me?!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1121
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,609
I didn't mean to take a kill
shot, are you okay?

1122
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,235
No, I'm not okay!

1123
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,776
- I hate you!
- Okay, maybe we should...

1124
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,327
I hate you!

1125
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,451
Will you grow up?!

1126
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,374
Me grow up?
I paid for this trip!

1127
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,664
- Ouch! Stop!
- I paid for everything!

1128
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,295
You didn't pay for this breakfast!

1129
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,089
It's a continental! It's free!

1130
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,377
Oh god, just once I wish you
would say "I am so sorry."

1131
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,713
"I am dead broke again, would
you please pay for my fro-yo?"

1132
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,924
For you, it's just a bunch
of heaped-on toppings!

1133
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,384
Why do you even bother
with the yogurt?

1134
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,389
Why don't you just go
to a fucking candy store?

1135
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,601
- Is there anything you're not afraid of?
- You think you are so strong.

1136
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,524
You quit everything that you try
or you do something stupid...

1137
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,897
to make sure that you fail.
You are the coward!

1138
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,321
I'm a coward? That's rich.

1139
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,155
Had enough?

1140
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,832
Oh, shit.

1141
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,756
Freeze, lesbians.

1142
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,641
Okay, I've gotten statements...

1143
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,473
from the witnesses
and the motel owner.

1144
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,270
From what I gather,
the altercation appears...

1145
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,599
to be over a man that you've
both been intimate with?

1146
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,858
- Not at the same time.
- I was first.

1147
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,690
Okay, the fella who stole your car.
What was his name?

1148
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,568
He didn't steal my car,
he left a note.

1149
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:37,609
I overreacted when I said that.
He didn't steal my car.

1150
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,864
Okay. What was his name?

1151
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,908
Uh, Ryan... Ryan...

1152
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,206
Ryan, um...

1153
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,710
You had sexual relations with this man
and you don't even know his name?

1154
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,379
I didn't have... relations...

1155
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,298
The desk clerk said you came in
last night with the damaged car.

1156
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,297
Officer, I have no memory of it.

1157
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,253
I'm still gonna need
the other fella's name.

1158
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:01,182
Oh, he accepted my Google Plus request.
I'll show you a picture of this guy.

1159
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,634
I'll show you his name,
his likes, his dislikes...

1160
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,515
That would have been helpful.

1161
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,891
Oh.

1162
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,024
Well, he's definitely
going to a wedding.

1163
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:13,693
His own.

1164
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,397
- He's getting married?
- Oh my god!

1165
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,198
You two are having a bad day.

1166
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,362
- Officer!
- Sit down!

1167
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,077
There is a woman out there
who's about to give her life over...

1168
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,704
to a liar and a cheat
and we have the opportunity...

1169
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,127
to stop him and to save her,
so please...

1170
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,580
I appeal to you,
not as a police officer...

1171
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,506
but as a woman, please.

1172
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,084
And we'll pay for all
the damage. Everything.

1173
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,467
Please?

1174
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,304
- You called for a cab?
- We're going to the Fort.

1175
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,018
- Where?
- Fort Lauderdale.

1176
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,725
Seriously?
That's gonna cost you.

1177
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,810
Well, we're just gonna
put it on my credit card.

1178
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,106
- We can split it three ways.
- No, I'll find my way home.

1179
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,441
Are you sure?
You don't wanna see how this thing ends?

1180
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,026
No, I really don't.

1181
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,907
Come on!
Let's go ruin a wedding!

1182
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,204
Let's go!

1183
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,439
Hey, ladies, we're almost there.

1184
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,774
- Game face. Game face!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,376
Excuse me, hi.
Um, the wedding, we're a little late...

1186
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,424
but can you tell us
where the wedding is, please?

1187
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,252
There's a wedding in Ballroom H.

1188
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,928
- Ballroom H, thank you, thank you.
- Just off the lobby.

1189
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,470
- There she is. Stop!
- Listen! Listen to us!

1190
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,348
- You're making a mistake, don't do it!
- You're making a mistake.

1191
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,771
Look, I know
you don't know who we are...

1192
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,474
but I slept with your future husband.

1193
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,684
We both did, last night...

1194
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,566
but we did not know that
he was getting married.

1195
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,647
He lied to us and
he will lie to you.

1196
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,778
- What have I been...
- Shut up, Dad!

1197
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,279
You deserve better.

1198
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,245
You're a piece of shit, Carlos!

1199
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:35,835
Carlos?

1200
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,965
- I feel bad about that.
- That was bad. That was on us.

1201
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,340
Hi. Would there possibly
be another wedding...

1202
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,840
at this hotel right now?

1203
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,935
Shit! We missed it!

1204
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,896
Son of a bitch went Asian.

1205
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,776
I'm not being racist,
I was just surprised.

1206
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,102
There he is!

1207
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,326
Let's go!

1208
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,537
Hey, Karen.

1209
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,417
Sorry!

1210
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,930
Hey, how're you doing?
You look beautiful.

1211
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,887
- What're you doing here?!
- You lying, fucking...

1212
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,688
piece of bent dick shit!

1213
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,354
Okay, okay!

1214
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,525
You're pissed off, but please,
please do not screw up my...

1215
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,732
Hey, you guys. Thank you
so much for coming.

1216
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,158
It's great seeing you.

1217
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,702
You lied to us, asshole!
You took advantage of us!

1218
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,621
I liked you.
I flew in a hot air balloon for you!

1219
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,621
- I concussed myself for you!
- Hold the fuck on!

1220
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,293
You two were throwing
yourselves at me...

1221
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,870
from the minute
I got on that plane.

1222
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,830
That was a game, right? I mean,
you two were trying to prove...

1223
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,290
I don't know what you were
trying to prove.

1224
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,468
But it sure as shit
had nothing to do with me.

1225
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,088
So, we kinda cancel
each other out.

1226
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:11,390
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1227
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,184
Oh, that was the most
beautiful ceremony.

1228
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,011
Thank you so much, Meemaw.

1229
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,142
These are my friends,
Meg and Kate.

1230
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,474
Oh. I'm sorry to
break in like that.

1231
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,936
Vernon! Would you excuse us
for just one minute?

1232
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:27,523
Vern, tell Ryan what you said.

1233
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,192
Shit. Is he right?

1234
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,201
Yeah.

1235
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,581
- Wait! Right?
- Yeah!

1236
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,036
- It was beautiful, wasn't it?
- Sorry, excuse us for just one minute.

1237
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,290
Sorry.

1238
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,915
You got married
ten minutes ago...

1239
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,046
and you slept with
two different women last night?

1240
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,548
- What is wrong with you?
- I know. I'm an asshole, I know.

1241
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,721
Asshole? It's like biblically
more than that.

1242
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,674
I want to punch you
in the mouth.

1243
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,680
Will you just listen to me
for one second?

1244
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,012
I have been with Genevieve since
freshman year of college...

1245
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:01,269
and hopefully I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with that woman.

1246
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,941
But freshman year.

1247
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,485
And two girls like you?
You're like every guy's dream.

1248
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,028
I know you're not gonna
believe this...

1249
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,573
but nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

1250
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,151
- Yeah, okay. You... you lied to us.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1251
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,613
Why didn't you tell us that you
were the one who was getting married?

1252
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,619
I didn't lie to you.
You never asked.

1253
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:21,994
Please don't destroy my wedding.

1254
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,705
Ryan. What're you doing?

1255
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:25,997
Hey!

1256
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,584
- Aren't you wearing a watch?
- Yeah, I...

1257
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,638
Hon, I said 5:50.
Not 6:00, not 6:05.

1258
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,306
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

1259
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,474
Oh, I-I was just doing a...

1260
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,433
Seriously, Ryan?

1261
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:44,312
Hi. I'm Genevieve.
And you are...?

1262
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,268
Gen, this is, uh, Meg and Kate.

1263
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,479
They were on the plane with me.
I told you. We, uh, drove down together.

1264
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,439
Oh, wow. You guys have been
through such an ordeal.

1265
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,445
Yeah, you have no idea.

1266
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,617
Well, thank you for
returning him to me safely.

1267
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,786
I was spazzing.

1268
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,824
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It stretches out the material.

1269
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,251
Oh, that...
that'll come right out.

1270
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,875
- I think it's the ham coquette.
- Did you talk to your parents?

1271
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,504
- I'm on my way.
- No, I'll do it.

1272
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,429
Do you think you can make it
to the garden by yourself?

1273
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:14,846
Yeah.

1274
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,059
Sorry, we were supposed to start
photos seven minutes ago.

1275
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,183
- Um, are you two...
- What?

1276
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,434
Staying?

1277
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:28,269
No, no, I think we just...
We-we just came to um...

1278
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,228
- To see your dress.
- Oh, the dress!

1279
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,734
- I love it.
- Oh, yeah, no.

1280
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,611
- It's Christopher Perry.
- It's so gorgeous.

1281
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,696
It was his idea,
he came here to design it.

1282
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,620
- I hope I can do it justice.
- Are you kidding me?

1283
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,824
I think that justice is very
well served, right, Meg?

1284
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,079
Absolutely.

1285
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,911
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1286
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,957
- Ryan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,464
Wow.

1288
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,171
Oh my god.

1289
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,882
- That was...
- Karma's a bitch.

1290
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,385
Ryan!

1291
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,063
I think our work here is done.

1292
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,188
Well, it looks like a nice one.

1293
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,899
Yeah, not bad.

1294
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,695
We have almost four hours
'til our flight.

1295
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,948
You wanna go mess up
another wedding?

1296
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,162
Go to the beach?

1297
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,411
What do you wanna do?

1298
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,094
Pardon me, I'm in the market
for a precious stone.

1299
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,218
Something lesser known,
perhaps a nice zinc?

1300
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,179
Zinc's not a stone,
it's an element.

1301
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,597
I know it's not a stone.
I was being poetic. Jesus.

1302
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,267
Well what, are you, stalking me
to bust my balls?

1303
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,650
No, I... Fuck!

1304
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,651
Can we start again?

1305
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,739
Hello, Craig, I'm an asshole.

1306
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,654
You were trying to be nice
to me and I was rude...

1307
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,116
and condescending and I didn't
even give you a chance.

1308
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,122
And I didn't want to walk
away from this...

1309
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,670
whole fucked-up trip
without telling you that.

1310
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,499
Okay. Thanks.

1311
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,467
Okay, bye.

1312
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,839
Wait, that's it?

1313
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:23,550
That's all I had planned.
I'm trying to be responsible.

1314
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,726
This is new for me.

1315
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,147
Okay, well... take care, Meg.

1316
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:34,982
What the hell.

1317
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,322
How about this?

1318
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,616
Yeah, that works, too.

1319
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,369
Bye, Craig.

1320
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,547
Who was that?

1321
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,509
Well, now I'm not so sure.

1322
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,016
- Hi.
- Hey.

1323
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,268
I was starting to get worried
about you.

1324
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:13,020
- Did you find him?
- Yeah.

1325
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,105
How'd it go?

1326
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,280
- I did most of the talking.
- Well, good.

1327
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,357
At least you got it
all out there.

1328
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,242
Almost.

1329
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,451
I don't think we can live
together anymore.

1330
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,003
It's me. I'm a mess.

1331
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,502
I need to get my shit together.

1332
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,382
And I can't, if I keep letting
you bail me out of everything.

1333
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,799
You're too good to me.
I don't know why...

1334
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,477
'cause I can be a real asshole
to you sometimes.

1335
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:54,023
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
boarding flight</i> 770 <i>to Seattle.</i>

1336
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,480
<i>Please have your
boarding passes ready.</i>

1337
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,738
This doesn't mean...

1338
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,411
- that we won't see each other.
- No, of course not.

1339
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,113
You're the most important
person in my life.

1340
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,573
You are, too,
ever since fifth grade.

1341
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,375
- We'll see each other as much as ever.
- Probably more. Yeah.

1342
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,163
Okay. Yeah.

1343
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,181
Wait. You're an amazing person,
and you always have been.

1344
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:33,017
I've always wanted
to be more like you.

1345
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,646
If anything,
I rely on you too much.

1346
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,738
I always cry at transitions.

1347
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:09,432
Miss Jeffries!

1348
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,807
Oh, hi, Demerius.
You're here early.

1349
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,723
Computer club.
I, um, did the report.

1350
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,933
You said two pages?

1351
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,610
So, is it okay that
I did it like that?

1352
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,522
- You drew this?
- Yeah, I finished the book.

1353
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:27,033
What they did to Piggy?
That was whack.

1354
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,361
Yeah, that was absolutely whack.

1355
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,492
So, is it okay?

1356
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,324
Yeah, it's okay.

1357
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,500
Miss Jeffries, hold up a second!

1358
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,879
- All right, I'll see you in class.
- See you in class.

1359
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,547
Gosh, you look great.

1360
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,092
Will you stop it?
I'm not gonna quit my job.

1361
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,714
Who asked you to quit your job?

1362
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,091
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

1363
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,513
- Yes, you did.
- No.

1364
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,090
I'll check my notes, but I'm...

1365
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,016
I'm pretty sure you
misunderstood me.

1366
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,596
No, on the contrary,
I'm here to offer you...

1367
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,227
the assistant volleyball
coach position.

1368
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:01,560
Mrs. Garcia's out
on maternity leave.

1369
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,069
Did you know she was pregnant?

1370
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,397
- No.
- Neither did I.

1371
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,405
Uh, well, just think about it.
Get back to me, okay?

1372
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,787
- Principle Moss!
- I can't, I got a board...

1373
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,163
No, no, come here,
I want you to see this.

1374
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,587
Demerius, that kid with
the comic, he did this.

1375
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,915
This is amazing. Look at that.

1376
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,752
You know what?
I was thinking about it over break...

1377
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,382
and I wanna shift the paradigm...

1378
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,634
of the left-brained
didactic teaching structure...

1379
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:34,183
to a more right-brained,
outside-the-box learning style.

1380
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,636
Do you follow?

1381
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:36,970
- I...
- I'm so sorry.

1382
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,681
It's such a bore when people
talk like assholes, isn't it?

1383
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,567
What I'm trying to say
is I want your support...

1384
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,194
to do more stuff like this.
Oh, and you know what?

1385
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,898
I looked into cutting hair
and you are absolutely right.

1386
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,776
Hairdressers make
a goddamn fortune.

1387
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,203
It almost sounds like
you're threatening me.

1388
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:57,875
Stanley... Stan... relax.
We are on the same team, here.

1389
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:01,999
I am just trying to keep
your instructional scaffolding in place.

1390
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,501
Especially right before testing.

1391
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,796
Oh, and you know what?

1392
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:11,221
Yes to volleyball.
Sounds like an adventure.

1393
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,426
Go Falcons!

1394
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,679
Edgeworth, he brought math
to economics.

1395
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,230
He wrote the essay on
application of math...

1396
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,650
to moral science, 1881.

1397
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,730
Leon Morris...
Theory of General Competitive-

1398
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,109
Hold on.

1399
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:35,028
Hello? Yes. I know, I know.
I'll be there.

1400
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,239
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Sorry, it was Kate.

1401
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:40,371
<i>Well, you know, I gotta get to
bed anyway. I'll see you later?</i>

1402
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,667
Sixteen days.

1403
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,703
<i>Sixteen days.</i>

1404
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,873
<i>Give me something
to dream about.</i>

1405
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,250
Oh, you scamp.

1406
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,551
<i>Come on.</i>

1407
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,929
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

1408
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,970
<i>Oh boy. You are the mo...</i>

1409
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:18,492
Hey.

1410
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,753
I'm here. Has it started?

1411
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,835
<i>I don't think that Kalynn's
going any farther.</i>

1412
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,542
<i>She's cracking.</i>

1413
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,423
<i>This is too hard.
I don't know if I can...</i>

1414
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,304
Who acts like that?
